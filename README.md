- 👋 Hi, I’m @LumaNova25 and I’m learning to code one step at a time. Not rushed, not perfect, just honest progress. I believe in starting small and showing up anyway.
- 👀 I’m interested in learning HTML, CSS, Javascript and whatever follows
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the basics of HTML and CSS
- 📫 How to reach me: www.linkedin.com/in/christiane-cornelissen-van-diermen-b02181231
- 👩‍🎓 Advice and suggestions on learning how to code are more than welcome
- 🙋‍♀️ Ik kom graag in contact met Nederlands sprekende mensen die ook lerende zijn en/of mij kunnen voorzien van advies, tips en informatie
- ⚡ Fun fact: Lumanova stands for new light and inner growth. I'm 43 years old and starting completely fresh in the world of developing
